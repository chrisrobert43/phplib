  PHPLIB package by David Beveridge

A library that provides session managent, authentication, permission
control, tables, forms, form elements, templating and sql query builder.
Compatible with a wide range of databases including MySQL, ODBC, Oracle,
Postgres, MSSQL etc.

The package is designed to be installed in a central shared folder with
just the files in the local folder being copied to each web site.


INSTALLTION

If you have received the .tar.gz instead of the .rpm you will have to
install it manually.  The rpm installs into /usr/share/phplib




If you are on a hosted web server where everything must go in your own 
webspace, do the following.  I'll assume you can cPanel with shell access.

if you are installing into the default web site on a web server that 
won't be using Virtual Hosts which you have root access to.
then...


  SINGLE  USER  SETUP
:-===================-:

cd ~/public_html
or
cd /var/www/html

tar zxvf ~/phplib-1.0.tar.gz
ln -s phplib-1.0 phplib
mv phplib/inc/* phplib/ && rmdir phplib/inc
mv phplib/local/phplib/* phplib/ && rmdir phplib/local/phplib
mv phplib/local/* . && rmdir phplib/local

These last two steps are required because ther shared files in /usr/share/phplib
are not available.



If you have root access to the server and are installing normally, 
then do the following instead.

To end up with the same as the rpm do the following assuming that the
tar file is in your home directory


  MULTI  USER  SETUP
:-==================-:

cd /usr/share/
tar zxvf ~/phplib-1.0.tar.gz
ln -s phplib-1.0 phplib
mv phplib/inc/* phplib/ && rmdir phplib/inc

The setup program assumes that you want your virtual host config files
placed in /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts if it exists or /etc/httpd/conf.d
it it doesn't.  If you want the virtual hosts in the vhosts folder,
you can follow these steps.

mkdir /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts
cat << EOF > /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhosts.conf
NameVirtualHost *:80
Include conf/vhosts/*.conf
EOF
 
If you have installed my backup package, a folder will be created
/var/spool/backup/mysql into which daily mysqldumps are placed
The setup program detects the existance of this folder and creates
a folder alias "/backup", so that backups can be browsed and downloaded.
A .htaccess file is created to protect this folder from unauthorised
access.

To create virtual hosts, use the provided python setup

cd /usr/share/phplib
./setup



To create the web site manually:-

1.  Setup the website in apache
2.  create a subfolder under the main html folder called phplib
    using the  single user setup instructions from above.
3.  password protect this folder with a .htaccess file
4.  create a mysql database and import the .sql schema files.
5.  attempt to run the autogenerator /phplib/autogen.php
6.  you will be prompted to enter details about the config you created
7.  autogen will attempt to create /phplib/.htauth.local
8.  if it fails it will display the contents on the web browser
    for you to paste into the file manually.
9.  create a subfolder /phplib/templates
10. create a subfolder /phplib/autogen
11. make these files writable by the web server.
    you may want to employ suphp or suexec if on a shared web server
