AUTOGENERATOR  for  PHPLIB.  ( David Beveridge <dave at bevhost dot com> )
:-==========================-:

PHPLIB is a great tool which make's it easy to produce forms, to add, edit & delete
data records as well as providing an SQL query tool to find records.

Whilst the examples given show how to bolt it all together, there is a huge amount 
of repetative work for each database table, defining form structures, add routings, 
delete routines etc.

I quickly decided that most of this information could derived from the original SQL
structure.  And so autogen.php was born.  I have now been using it for several years
and has gone through many enhancements.

What changes for each php file is the table name and the column specifications for the table.

The basic structure of an add/view/edit/copy/delete/search table function is



page_open
check view permissions

if submit form
   check edit permissions
   if Add/Edit
      if validate ok
         save
      else 
         reprint form
      page_close
   if delete
      delete
   page_close
else
   if load form
      get data

if load data
   if view/delete 
	freeze for to prevent edit
   show form
   page_close

default action
   show query form
   define columns to display
   define map nice column names for display
   if query form submit
	set query
   else
	set default query
   do query
   show result 

page_close


This is the basic structure of TableName.php files that are created for every table in the database

In addition, for each table, two more files are created.
	TableNameform.ihtml		a file to be included whenever you want a
					form to appear if you want to change the 
					layout of the form edit this file
	TableName.inc			a file containing the data format setup 
					[column specifications] edit this file 
					if you want to change the data validation 
					rules

NOTICE REGARDING EDITOR CHOICE - PHPLIB integrates with 2 different editors.

$_ENV["editor"] tells us which WYSIWYG editor is installed
 fckeditor,	is a free editor and file uploader that works well in firefox and ie
 ckeditor,	is a better free editor that works in more browsers but does not
	     	have a file uploader build in
 ckfinder,	is a file uploader for ckeditor, 
	     	but is not free (see www.ckfinder.com for pricing)

If you set $_ENV["editor"]='ckfinder' then the editor is ckeditor with ckfinder integrated.

If you try to switch from fck to cf editor you will discover that the image and file folders are not the same.
So when you open the file browser in the other editor there will be no files visible.


  How to use the PHPLIB Autogenerator
:-===================================-:

Although the Menu Editor and Content Editor allows PHPLIB to be used as a CMS, 
this is not the main purpose for which it can be used.  The PHPLIB autogenerator
is designed to take away the repeative work of making form templates and tables 
definition files required for database applications.

To use autogen your should first define your database schema then run autogen to 
analyse your tables and create a working application for you to modify.

Sometimes the data for your application already exists.  In this case you can 
convert the data to a CSV file and import it into the database, then run the autogen.

As an example, here is details on how to get an Australian Postcodes table running.

visit http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/
Click on Postcode Datafile, OK
Click on Download Full Postcode Database
Save the file.

Goto /phplib/import.php on your new web site.
Browse for the .zip file you just downloaded from Australia Post.
Upload the file.
Submit for import into SQL.

Goto /phplib/autogen.php
The files are now created in phplib/autogen/
copy the .inc and .ihtml files to the phplib folder and any .php files you want to document root (public_html).

You should now be able to add the .php file to somewhere on the menu in your
application.  You may want to restrict access to just admin to start with.
