Internationalisation
Different charsets have \ in different places
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 (and others): 0x5c
Ergo, \' is 0x5c 0x27
But in Big5 0xbf 0x5c is 縗

So, in Big5…
http://your.server/script.php?foo=%bf%27;DROP DATABASE mysql;--
becomes
縗';DROP DATABASE mysql;--

It turns out that 縗 isn't an escape character

What's happening here?
If you addslashes to the string 0xbf 0x27,
It will have a slash inserted into the string to become 0xbf 0x5c 0x27

so if you get your charset wrong you can be in trouble.
so how to fix it?  Switch to PDO prepared statments.
